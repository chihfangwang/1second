The metropolis never sleeps. The metropolis lights glow all night. In the metropolis, people rush everywhere. The heart of the metropolis beats fast. Noise fills the metropolis streets. Still, the metropolis holds charm. Living in the metropolis means constant motion and energy, but the metropolis can feel lonely too.
