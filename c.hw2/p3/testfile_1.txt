Every morning, I Wake up to the sound of birds singing outside my window. The soft sunlight begins to Wake the flowers in the garden, causing them to bloom in vibrant colors. As I get out of bed, I try to Wake my mind, readying myself for the day ahead. It's always a challenge, but with each passing moment, I feel more fresh than before. Sometimes, I wish I could just stay in bed and Wake up later, but the day calls, and I must rise. By the time I’m fully Wake up, the world outside is already in motion, and I’m ready to join it.
Wake
