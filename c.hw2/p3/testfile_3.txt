The Imperium of Man is the galaxy-spanning interstellar empire which rules over the vast majority of the Human race in the 41st Millennium AD. The founder and immortal ruler of the Imperium is the Emperor of Mankind, the God-Emperor of a million worlds who is the most powerful Human psyker ever born. Founding the Imperium over ten thousand standard years ago during the Great Crusade era of the late 30th Millennium AD, the Emperor has been physically imprisoned within the Golden Throne on Terra since He was horribly wounded and disfigured during the great galactic civil war with His wayward son Horus.
